                    Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.
                     Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, 
                     followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the 
                     Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.

                <h1>AGENT ROLES</h1>
                <div class="section3Items">
                    <h2>Duelist:</h2>
                    <p>The first role we are going to dive into is the role that’s focused on contesting and winning space for your team; the Duelist. 

                        When you think of what it means to be a star Valorant player or hard carrying your teammates to victory, the Duelists are often the first 
                        agent class to come to mind. Taking constant gun fights, being the center of the action, and paving the way for your team’s success; 
                        the best Duelists embody what it means to be aggressive and confident, always willing to push their mechanics to the limit. Do this well 
                        and you’ll end up making lots of “space” for your team. </p>

                    <h2>Initiator:</h2>
                    <p>If you consider yourself a team player and you enjoy pulling the strings behind the scenes, this is the role for you. Behind every top fragging 
                        Jett should be the Initiator racking up ten-plus assists. 
                        The goal of Initiators is to gather information about the enemy team and make taking space easier. Now don’t get me wrong, some good lineups 
                        are always helpful for not only knowing exactly what your utility is revealing, but also to make sure you get max value from that utility. 
                        But what if we told you, it’s not about where your utility is used, but when you use it that counts? An Initiator’s patience will determine 
                        not only how the start of rounds will be played out, but how your team recovers if something goes wrong. Timing is the most important aspect 
                        of playing the Initiator role. You could have a good dart or flash, but if it’s mistimed it effectively goes to waste and could even lead to 
                        hurting your team.</p>

                    <h2>Controller:</h2>
                    <p>The Controller role is looked at by many as the least interesting role to play, but this is far from the truth. Controller is a role built 
                        for players who like to think outside the box. Yes, the basic job of a Controller – to smoke off the common angles, or angles your team can’t 
                        safely hold – is straightforward. However, once you achieve mastery of the basics, that’s when you can use your brain to slowly and systematically 
                        destroy the enemy team. 
                        A Controller’s primary job is already important: smoking off dangerous angles so that enemies need to think twice before pressuring your team. 
                        But you’re also denying information of your team’s positions and delaying enemies from aggressing. You can see this being done on both attack 
                        and defense and it’s the foundation of the role. </p>

                    <h2>Sentinel:</h2>
                    <p>The final role we will be covering in this video is of course the Sentinel role; the role for players who love to play on their own terms 
                        and want to set traps for the enemy team. 
                        The main goal of any Sentinel is to retain control of areas of the map that are high value. Examples of this would be bomb sites or your 
                        team’s flank on attack. </p>
