                    Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG where you play a vague and mysterious “traveler” 
                    from another world who arrives in the land of Teyvat before being attacked by a sorceress or God, 
                    and your twin is captured. After waking up on a beach at level one and with zero loot, you set off on a 
                    quest to find your lost sibling that involves a whole lot of picking fruit, crafting items, and fighting 
                    deities, but surprisingly little in the way of actually searching for your twin. Because, just like during 
                    Link's rush to save Zelda, completing these quests where you *checks notes* feed ducks is way more important.

                    <h2>Mondstadt:</h2>
                    <p>The City of Freedom is the player’s first brush with the world of Teyvat. It is governed by Lord Barbatos, the Anemo Archon. 
                        However, Barbatos’ presence is rarely felt among the people of Mondstadt as he refuses to rule over his people directly. 
                        Though it may be strange to those from other nations, it rings true to the region’s ideal of freedom. Mondstadt of Genshin 
                        Impact is inspired by the real-world country of Germany.</p>

                    <h2>Liyue:</h2>
                    <p>Liyue values the sanctity of contracts above all else. Thus, the people gather yearly during the Rite of Descension to heed the guidance of 
                        their Geo Archon, Morax. As one of the oldest Archons, Morax is a wise god, providing counsel to ensure prosperous trade. However, as the 
                        Genshin Impact Archon Quest reveals, he’s growing weary of his prominent role. Liyue is based off real-world China.</p>

                    <h2>Inazuma:</h2>
                    <p>Inazuma is the Land of Eternity and the most hostile region that players have encountered thus far. Presided over by the cut-throat Electro Archon, 
                        Raiden Ei, locals run the risk of losing their Genshin Impact Vision due to the Vision Hunt Decree. Taking these Visions away brings Inazuma one 
                        step closer to eternity. Inazuma takes inspiration from real-world Japan.</p>

                    <h2>Sumeru:</h2>
                    <p>Sumeru (as well as the following regions) has yet to be released. As such, players don’t have much to go on yet. What the community does 
                        know is that Sumeru prizes the virtue of wisdom and is presided over by the Dendro Archon, Kusanali. Sumeru Academia can be found here, and it’s 
                        one of the most prominent educational institutions in Teyvat. Notably, Genshin Impact’s Lisa was once a student there. Sumeru is reportedly 
                        based on real-world SWANA regions.</p>
                        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTkJ7i6mBTtEgZlUTFZIAlRcJF_PHW0x-okKabgHkEJ1yXu-tN_HjGYGlaG9bltrk9jbzA&usqp=CAU" alt="Sumeru" class="image2">

                    <h2>Fontaine:</h2>
                    <p>Fontaine suggest that the region prizes technology, culture, and arts. The toymaker Bertrand from the recent Core of Apparatus Genshin Impact 
                        event showcases this with his special machine that creates intricate mechanical toys. The region is governed by the Hydro Archon whose 
                        identity is yet unknown. Fontaine is based off real-world France.</p>
                        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSZ-KqPgSdMyxUALvG5gcoYRzF1EWSsz2NeDREQfrY3Tw&s" alt="Fontaine" class="image2">

                    <h2>Khaenri’ah:</h2>
                    <p>Khaenri'ah is the infamous nation without a god. Kaeya of Genshin Impact, as well as Dainsleif, came from this land. The region faced a 
                        violent cataclysm at the hands of the gods, turning the original inhabitants into monsters that formed the Abyss Order. Now, they seek revenge.</p>

                    <h2>The Dark Sea:</h2>
                    <p>Finally, the Dark Sea is an umbrella term that refers to the lands beyond Teyvat. Inazuma borders the edge of the Dark Sea. It’s 
                        said that the gods who lost during the Genshin Impact Archon War fled to the Dark Sea, unwilling to live under the control of the 
                        official Archons.</p>

                    <p>The story of Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat which is home to seven major nations: Mondstadt, 
                        Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. These nations are ruled over by deities known as Archons, 
                        part of a group of gods called "The Seven." Each Archon is associated with one of the seven elements of Teyvat, 
                        which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. For example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over 
                        by Barbatos the Anemo Archon, and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by its people. Apart from the 
                        seven nations, there was the nation of Khaenri'ah that lived independently from the authority of gods.
                        Celestia is the main heavenly body that presides over Teyvat and is in direct connection with The Seven. A floating 
                        island seen in the sky is believed to be it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who have ascended to godhood. 
                        Humans that are granted Visions, magical gems that grant bearers the ability to command elemental power, are called 
                        "allogenes" — ones with the potential to reach godhood.
                        While gods rule, the nations also have their own human governing bodies: the Knights of Favonius to Mondstadt, the 
                        Qixing to Liyue, the Shogunate to Inazuma, the Akademiya to Sumeru, and the Maison Gardiennage to Fontaine.</p>

                    <h2>PLOT:</h2>
                    <p>A pair of "star traveler" twins who visit different worlds arrive in the world of Teyvat and witness the destruction 
                        of the nation of Khaenri'ah. While attempting to flee the chaos, an unnamed god blocks their path and separates them:
                         she captures one and seals away the power of the other. The sealed twin (known as the "Traveler") awakens five hundred 
                         years later and meets Paimon, who becomes their companion. For months, they travel together and then make their way to
                          Mondstadt. There, they begin the search for the Traveler's missing sibling.</p>

                    <h2>CHARACTERS:</h2>
                    <p>As Paimon and the Traveler are on their way to Mondstadt, they meet Amber of the Knights of Favonius — she had been 
                        scouting monster camps nearby. After brief questioning, she offers to escort the duo to the city after completing her tasks. 
                        Later, a dragon dubbed "Stormterror" attacks Mondstadt, and the Traveler gets caught by one of his whirlwinds. The Traveler 
                        manages to fend off the dragon and catches the attention of the Knights of Favonius. They become acquainted with other members: 
                        Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and resident librarian Lisa. (Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa are the three free playable 
                        characters the player would obtain in the game.) The Traveler agrees to help the Knights resolve the ongoing crisis and gains more 
                        allies: Venti, a local bard who wants to help the dragon, and wine tycoon Diluc.</p>
