                    Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The game is free-to-play and is only 
                    monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities 
                    and traits. There are six roles that define the main purpose of heroes: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter, Mage, and Support. These roles determine 
                    the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.

                <p id="text1">There are three lanes on the map: Top Lane, Middle Lane (or Mid Lane) and Bottom Lane (or Bot Lane).
                    All three lanes are set up with three turrets each and your goal is to get through waves of minions and destroy all the turrets. 
                    Once you’ve passed the turrets you need to destroy enemy base building to win the game.
                    When pushing lanes to get to a turret you don’t want to just charge in and fire wildly. That’s only going to amount to premature defeat.
                    Clear enemy minions as quick as possible so you have more time to attack the turrets. If your minions able to survived until the enemies 
                    turret ring, attack it until the tower is destroyed.

                    <h2>Jungling:</h2>
                    <p>Jungle is an area on the map between three lanes. Jungle areas weave and work their way into the map, so you can cut through them to get to 
                        one of the other lanes without having to go back and around.
                        The point of the jungles is to have a method of gaining gold or experience for your hero faster. There are monsters scattered throughout the 
                        jungle areas for you to slay in return for those rewards.
                        At the start of the match, the monsters are spawned and in the waiting period for the minions, you can spend that time killing one of the monsters. 
                        As the match goes on more powerful ones spawn for more powerful bonuses.
                        In some cases defeating a monster will give your heroes a certain type of bonus. They range from Health Regen, Experience to Gold.
                        There are certain heroes that are encouraged to the jungle, while some others are not. Check first your heroes' specialty in the jungle before 
                        locking in jungling items, emblems and spells.
                        Jungler is the fit role to take jungle area. They able to gain golds and experiences from killing jungle monsters. While Mid Laner and Sidelaner 
                        gain golds and experiences from clearing minions waves and Roamer gain golds and experiences from roaming after purchase roam items.
                        Try NOT to taking jungle monsters unless you are a jungler, otherwise your ally jungler will get behind in gold and experience. 
                        Thus they will got delayed from purchasing items and not able to dominate the game.</p>

                    <h2>Exp Lance:</h2>
                    <p>The primary objective in the EXP Lane revolves around skill development and hero level. Heroes in this lane aspire to attain high levels,
                         bolstered by their unique abilities to assist their allies.
                        Two primary avenues to accrue EXP emerge: vanquishing Turtles or defeating Siege Minions. The Turtle bestows buffs upon the last hitter and 
                        distributes Experience points to nearby allies participating in its downfall.
                        The EXP Lane typically beckons robust and resilient heroes like Fighters and Tanks. Among the notable choices are Balmond, Alucard, Zilong, 
                        Bane, and Terizla.</p>

                    <h2>Gold Lane:</h2>
                    <p>Contrasting the EXP Lane, the Gold Lane stands apart, distinguished by its ‘$’ emblem. Alternatively, one can gauge its position based on the 
                        Turtle’s whereabouts, as the Gold Lane stretches furthest from the Turtle’s domain. As a resident of Gold Lane, your primary mission revolves 
                        around amassing wealth. Gold Lane heroes prioritize basic attacks and skills characterized by swift cooldowns.
                        To amass riches, you have two primary avenues: dispatching Creep Jungle Crabs and eliminating Siege Minions. Inhabitants of this lane predominantly 
                        hail from the Marksman role. Notable examples include Miya, Lesley, Claude, and Wanwan..</p>
                        <img src="https://blog.unipin.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/lane-ml-5.jpg" alt="Gold Lane" class="image2">
                    <hr>
                    
                    <h2>Mid Lane</h2>
                    <p>The Mid Lane, often referred to as the heart of the battlefield, holds its ground firmly at the center of the map. 
                        This pivotal position is restricted by a distinctive diagonal line, serving as the Mid Lane boundary for both competing teams. 
                        In Mobile Legends (ML), the Midlaner plays an extraordinarily vital role. Why, you ask? The hero stationed in this lane must master 
                        the art of two essential tasks: swiftly dispatching the enemy minion waves and lending a hand to comrades in need.
                        Being strategically positioned in the middle gives the Midlaner a distinct advantage – minion waves arrive quicker than other lanes. 
                        Thus, besides engaging with foes, the Midlaner must also be able to eliminate their minions efficiently.
                        Delving into the realm of the Midlaner inevitably involves discussing the safeguarding of the tower. Think of the first Midlaner tower as 
                        the linchpin of your team’s dominance. While it remains standing, you can traverse the lane, supporting your allies without constantly 
                        fretting about enemy assaults.
                        However, once the Midlaner’s initial tower succumbs to enemy forces, it becomes increasingly arduous to maintain control of the map’s center. 
                        Rotating to other lanes becomes a precarious endeavor. Moreover, the adversary gains the upper hand, potentially seizing control of your forest 
                        creatures.
                        Traditionally, the Midlaner position is entrusted to Mages, renowned for their explosive damage that effectively clears waves. Think of heroes 
                        like Pharsha, Nana, Gord, Xavier, and Chang’e.</p>

                    <h2>Roaming</h2>
                    <p>Lastly, let’s explore the fascinating realm of Roaming within the Mobile Legends arena. Depicted by a distinctive box-shaped lane logo, 
                        Roaming embodies a role that embodies the essence of teamwork and disruption. A successful Roamer possesses an innate knack for reading 
                        the map and impeccable timing. Your prompt arrival can make all the difference when your comrades find themselves in dire straits. 
                        The crux of the role? Ensuring that your lane hero remains unscathed.
                        Some Roamers, equipped with long-range attacks, also moonlight as distractions to enemy Junglers. Their tactics may involve luring away 
                        creep buffs, stealing last hits, and more. Heroes that excel in the Roaming role include Grock, Angela, Franco, Akai, Alice, and Estes.</p>
